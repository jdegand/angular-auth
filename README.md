# Angular Auth

Angular authentication based off this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8a8ituFkls).  

## Built With

- [Angular](https://angular.dev)
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.7.
- [Realworld API](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/)

## Thoughts

- Looking into using Realworld API as a mock for Angular authentication.  This might speed up my process for Angular frontend creation as I can progress further without stopping to create a backend.     
- `getRawValue` can be a way to get around Typescript problems when you submit a form value that doesn't include all properties of the interface type of the API's payload.  You could also use `Partial`.
